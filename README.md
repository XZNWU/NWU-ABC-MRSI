# NWU-ABC-MRSI
The NWU-ABC-MRSI dataset contains $10,242$ multi-temporal remote sensing images of three object categories (i.e., vehicle, aeroplane, and ship). After the initial bounding box annotation generation process, the remaining $4,231$ images with bounding-box annotations are used for the subsequent training and validation of the object detector.
